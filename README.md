# CodeCademy-Portfolio-Project
This is an ongoing development for Codecademy's Porfolio Project.  I have started the base layout, which are all the pages and basic page content.

## Next Steps
The next steps I will take with this project is to add graphics that show different design projects that I have done.  
I will also bring in skill icons of all the skill sets I currently have and those that I have recently learned.
